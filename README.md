#  Software Engineering Summative Assignment 1: Report

## Introduction

This project is for the submission of summative assignment 1 of the Software Engineering course. To compelete this assignment the brief has detailed that the project needs to meet the following:

1. Propose a new product for your employer or a small-scale side project for your organisation. It may be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a simple web app, e.g., a currency converter (written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a data product, e.g., a Jupyter notebook with some data visualisations that collects data from a web API or an online SQL database

2. Design your product using Figma or an alternative.
3. Outline how you planned your project using modern planning techniques (e.g., agile with sprints). Reflect on your planning using a project Project Management Tool (we strongly recommend GitHub Projects, a free alternative to Jira).
4. Capture the requirements for your project as issues or tickets shown via your chosen Project Management Tool
5. Summarise how you built the minimal viable product or a prototype step by step in a written report.
6. Use Test Driven Development to produce an initial codebase for your product.
7. Use GitHub or an alternative to add features to your prototype or MVP gradually.
8. Document your MVP with README documentation.
9. Document and use a ticketing system according to the documentation. Conventionally one ticket is one feature corresponding to one branch and one pull request.
10. Evaluate your design in a dedicated “Evaluation” section of your README

The project will involve creating a Python function that takes input integers and an integer sequence to generate corresponding age bands. The initial design of the product will be outlined in this README file. The project management and planning will be conducted using GitHub Project Boards, where issues will be raised and treated as sprints in an Agile-like methodology. The function will be tested using the pytest library.

The final product will be documented with README documentation and will be evaluated in a dedicated "Evaluation" section of the README.
